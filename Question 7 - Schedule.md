Daily Planner

My day was precisely planned out.
Until 4 days ago my routine looked along the lines of:

1. Snooze 5 am alarm until 5: 30 am.
2. Get done for work.
3. Leave at 6:45 am and start my 7:30 am – 4:30 pm job.
3. Get home at 5:30 pm.
4. Clean me off and have a snack to re-energize.
5. Play soccer from 6:30 pm – 8:30 pm (Monday to Wednesday).
6. Eat supper when I get back.
7. Sleep at 10 pm.
8. Repeat…

1 - The alarm goes off at 4:30 am. Get the Laptop and revise over codes and work that needs more understanding.
2 - Get done for work at 5:30 am.
3 - Have a high in fiber breakfast to mentally commit to work for 9 hours and 6 hours of Bootcamp work.
4 - Get home from work and read through the work prescribed by the syllabus for better understanding.
5 - Work on coding for 2 hours.
6 - Complete the Tilde tasks to the best of my ability.
7 - Have supper and prepare video tutorials on different forms of code and how to apply them.
8 - Listen to some music to calm down while I read through my work and assist group members.

I perform at the best of my ability in the early hours of the morning while my brain is fresh and is not sleep-deprived.
