Why a Data Engineer?

To understand why one chooses a path we first need to understand what that path consists of. Data Engineering is the “ability to design, build, and maintain data warehouses, where raw data is transformed and stored in queryable forms.” - Umuzi

Data Engineering is one of the many sought-after skills in the I.T industry as it identifies trends in data sets and developing algorithms to assist with making raw data more useful to society. The ability to help advance and simplify the information we receive makes me believe that technology is in the palm of my hands. Looking at how society is progressing it is obvious that technology is at the forefront of humanity, being on the winning has always been a stamp in my life and where does it get better than Umuzi to show me the ropes and provide me with the proper techniques to inspire another generation.
