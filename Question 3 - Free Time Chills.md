Free Time Chill: 101

Honestly getting free time throughout the week besides weekends is a rarity but I use that 3 hours wisely. Exercise in the form of playing indoor football from Monday – Wednesday is the highlight of my weekdays, if I’m not running with a ball at my feet for 2 hours then watching soccer is the next best thing.

Recently a new family member has joined the team in the form of a golden-brown Pitbull dog called Connor. He turns 1 year old soon which means he's still a puppy and that in itself is exhausting but distracting on everyday struggles.
Most weekends are spent binge-watching horror movies or series which piques my interest after the first 2 episodes. I went through a phase in 2020 reading romance novels most times but since outdoor activities are no longer restricted with lockdown playing football is my go-to.

I’m looking forward to changing that routine by adding some code tutorials to improve my knowledge of engineering data and progressing in my career path.
