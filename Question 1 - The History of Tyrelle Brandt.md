The history of Tyrelle Michael Deriece Brandt unfolds!!!

On this day, 16th October 1998 a young mind was born at approximately 10:54 am he had his first breath of fresh air. 
Fun fact, not many people know the exact time the world announced their greeting in fact 1 in 5 people know the hour they were born while the rest struggle to remember their third birthday (this is not a fact but for dramatic effort). Tyrelle Brandt an only son to Michael O’Brian, an Irishman who migrated to South Africa in 1988 to pursue greater opportunities and Shireen Brandt, a local South African female who was born in a small town on the outskirts of Kimberley called Jan Kempdrop was the first official born-free in the immediate family of the Brandt’s. Born and raised in the heart of Johannesburg where he stayed with his grandmother and 4 other family members in a 3-bedroom house close to the suburbs of Newlands. He attended Frankin D. Roosevelt primary school in 2005 and completed his schooling career at Roosevelt High school in 2017. Throughout Tyrelle’s high schooling years he became fond of computers and the technological aspect of the world, it was in 2016 when he learned about Software Engineering and exactly what it would take to get into this profession. He applied at every Government institution within his Town but was not accepted at any until a lady approached him from the IIE Varsity College and proposed a Higher Certificate in IT Support Services at the institution.

After graduating in 2017 with a bachelor’s pass, he went on to study at the IIE Varsity College institution where he received not only the Certificate but the acceptance for the Bachelor's Degree in Computing Science. Unfortunately, the year 2020 which began with great promise brought upon the 21st century’s greatest challenge and the stagnation of this young man momentum but history is yet to be written for the Great Tyrelle Michael Deriece Brandt.
