Goals

The endless possibilities of succeeding in the field allow me to wake up every morning with more determination to excel at the Bootcamp and progress to the next phase.

The personal goal I set out for myself was to set my mind on a task and give it mine all without any regrets. Nothing is a failure in my life, just setbacks and room to grow my knowledge.
My goals are always set in the short term of 12 – 18 months. Like paying off my student loans which my mother took out for me.
Create a local courier service portal for the Shoprite store in my area for items essential for daily consumption.

I always dreamt of getting a house on the hill and having everyone in my family stay there.
Spread awareness about the Umuzi community to my community about the opportunities in the form of adverts or billboards.

To answer the question… Worth enough to do something about my situation and wake up with more hunger and determination.
