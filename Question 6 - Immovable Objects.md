Brick Walls

I’d be lying if I started with the statement “Nothing, take me now”. Everyone has their trials and tribulations on their way to success, mine comes in the form of working and supplying food on the table. Not a breadwinner but a household contributor.

The lack of understanding or knowledge for certain aspects of the course might come as a problem but I have a supportive group that communicates well and provides solutions. I know my progression cannot solely depend on me getting into this program but that is where my race starts, and I want this race to begin with Umuzi.
