Plagiarism

The process of taking credit for someone else work and claiming it as your own. Although this construct isnâ€™t deemed a criminal offense, it is still an infringement on the rights of the authors of which the work you stole. Not speaking up for yourself is an infringement on your right to free speech. Therefore, not understanding the work gives the responsibility to voice that concern and seek support.

There is nothing wrong with lack of knowledge or understanding but there is something concerning about settling with the fact thereof. Understanding the work allows for better practice and the ability to apply the knowledge you gained for stable independence in the field of study or profession.
