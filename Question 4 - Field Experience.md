“Prior” Experience

I have no practical or work experience to show for this field. In Varsity College learned to design small websites which could store files and create stopwatches with the notepad ++ as an application. Over the past 4 days, I taught myself to code and apply the knowledge of coding basic functions for Python and navigating my way through the Global Information Tracker know as Git, including the Github interface.

I am looking to gain more knowledge and hopefully practical experience with Umuzi in the weeks and months to come.
